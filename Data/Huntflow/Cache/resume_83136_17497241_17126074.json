The challenge was to create an app that works offline too, so people with bad or no internet connection could interact with the app and leave reviews. This was achieved by learning CacheAPI, ServiceWorkers and IndexedDB. App was done with accessibility in mind (WAI-ARIA), so it's accessible by people with disabilities. Finally I optimised the app to meet performance benchmarks requirements and the final result is 98/100 (Lighthouse score). This was achieved by WebWorkers, lazy loading images and other optimisations.\n● SPAs (React with GraphQL API) and some landing pages.","skills":null},{"position":"Engineer","date_from":{"year":2013,"month":2,"day":1,"precision":2},"date_to":{"year":2016,"month":9,"day":1,"precision":2},"company":"Decorare Vita LLC, Saint-Petersburg​","experience_area":null,"industries":null,"description":"Development and integration of IT services in the service sector.\nRuslan Dzyubanov\nFront-End Developer\n● Analysed and processed various requests/incidents.\n● Provided service desk for the company's products.\n● Integrated services to improve the quality of work (voip, messenger).\n● Administered business services on Windows servers.\n● Worked with Hyper-V, mostly for software testing purposes.\n● Configured network equipment, switching.\n● Maintained technical documentation.","skills":null},{"position":"Engineer","date_from":{"year":2008,"month":4,"day":1,"precision":2},"date_to":{"year":2012,"month":12,"day":1,"precision":2},"company":"Sevzapelectrosetstroy JSC, Saint-Petersburg","experience_area":null,"industries":null,"description":"Business: The largest company in the construction of power plant facilities.\n● Organised and participated in the development of our own tracking platform built with PHP &amp; MySQL.
